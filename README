bbdbm is a database manager working both as a server-centrilised SQL-style service with a dedicated user and daemon,
and as a one-to-one portable database manager.
 
It includes an API at any level -- raw bytes level, up to fully abstract struct-typed level--,
security features, and documentation -- again, at any level of usage.
